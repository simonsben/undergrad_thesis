# Installation instructions

## Package install

All of the packages should be listed under `requirements.txt` in the main directory.
All you should have to do to install them is go into your virtual environment, then run 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Solver installation

If you are using any of the analytical solvers you will need to install them specifically.
There are bash scripts to automate the download and building of these solvers (see `scripts`).
