# Installation instructions

## Virtual environment (venv)

Personally I use a venv so you don't have to install everything globally.
Its pretty easy to set that up with most IDEs, so you shouldn't have to go through the command line.

## Package install

All of the packages should be listed under `requirements.txt` in the main directory.
All you should have to do to install them is go into your virtual environment, then run 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Other notes

### IDE choice

If you're looking for a decent IDE id recommend PyCharm, its pretty good for most things and 
does you a lot of favours.
