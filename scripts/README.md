# Scripts

The bash scripts in this directory are for automating the download and building of additional solvers.
The solvers that are currently used are:

* Bonmin
* Couenne
* GLPK
* Ipopt

**NOTE**: when the scripts are executed they will create a new directory, `~/.[solver_name]`,  where it will build the solver
