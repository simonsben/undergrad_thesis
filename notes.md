* Make problem definition its own section
* Why is there a problem definition and a problem statement
* Move everything in results one header up
* call numerical solutions numerical optimal solutions
* Merge conclusion with next steps

## into
* Write problem as a question

## backgound

* always make sure to use acronym when we define it
* Move away from *contagion process* and call it urn scheme
* talk about how its hard to get time n solution
* talk about how its almost impossible to analytically optimize the infeciton at time n for a general network topology
* be more precise with proof for reduced
